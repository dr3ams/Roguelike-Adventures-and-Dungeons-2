; All toggles may be set to "banned", "false", "true", or "unset".
; "unset" adopts the default value - what this means depends on general.category.
; "banned" completely prevents the feature from loading, similar to "false" in
; pre-2.0 versions of Fabrication. On servers, setting an option to banned
; (even if it's client-only) will also prevent clients connecting to the
; server from enabling it (if they are well-behaved; it is easy to make a
; hacked version of Fabrication that ignores this, so don't rely on it.)
