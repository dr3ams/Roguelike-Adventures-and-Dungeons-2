		#* FLAT: chance is the percentage chance for the item to drop if the difficulty criteria matches
		#* SCALING: each point of difficulty >= 'difficulty to drop the item' will be multiplied by the chance (e.g. chance 2% and difficulty 10, difficulty required 5, chance to drop the item will be chance * (difficulty - difficulty_required + 1) = 2% * (10 - 5 + 1) = 12%)
		#By default Withers have 2% chance per difficulty >= 2 to drop 1 shard + 4% chance per difficulty >= 4 to drop 2 shards + 8% chance per difficulty >= 8 to drop 4 shards.
