				"Taming a rat is considered difficult as they actively try and avoid players. It is impossible to tame a Plague Rat, but a normal Rat is tamed using Cheese. Like other food items, rats will eat cheese items that are thrown on the floor. However, wild rats have a trust variable that increases with each feeding of cheese. As the rat slowly trusts the player it will not flee as fast or far, and by the time it has had 10 cheese, it will trust the player enough not to flee. Once the rat has been fed cheese 10 times, each additional feeding will have a 33% chance of taming the rat. It can take up to 15 times to tame a rat. Rats are tamed when they make heart particles and can be interacted with."
