Then, you place one enchanted item on each pillar (target the pillar and right click it while holding the item).  Once all four pillars hold an item, the Altar will begin to drain experience from nearby players.  The amount of experience required is based on the levels an rarities of the provided enchantments.  Once the experience has been drained, all four items will be consumed, and a newly created enchanted book will be created.  The new enchantments are random, but better enchantments will be obtained with higher levels and rarities of provided enchantments.  The Altar of the Sea can generate treasure enchantments."]

			description: ["The Enchantment Library is a block focused on storing enchantments.  Simply insert an enchanted book, and every enchantment on that book will be stored in the library internally.  Each enchantment on a deposited book will be stored as points.  A point is simply equivalent to a level 1 enchantment, and as such an enchantment is worth the amount of points it would take to combine it from level one books (2^(level -1) points per level).  The library also records the max level it has ever seen for a given enchantment, and you may only extract enchantments up to that level.  Meaning if you want to be able to extract a higher level of an enchantment, the library will need to have had that level deposited at least one time.To extract enchantments from the library, simply click the tile of the enchantment you want to extract, and it will be extracted to the output slot.  If the output slot is empty, a new enchanted book will be generated.  If it is not empty, it will apply the next level of that enchantment to the book (if you have enough points).  Shift-clicking on a tile will attempt to extract the max level available (if you have enough points).  The point cost for extracting is shown in the tooltip.  If that tooltip is red, you do not have enough points for that operation."]

Splitting is a new enchantment that allows you to drop an anvil on an enchanted book with multiple enchantments, and receive an individual book for each level.  However, this process only has a 20% success chance per level of splitting, and will always cause damage to the anvil (but can be prevented by unbreaking).  Obliteration is similar, it has the same success rules, but it works on books with a single enchantment above level one.  It will create two books, each a level lower than the original.  Think of it as the inverse of combining two books in an anvil."]

				"Project MMO allows players to advance through the game in their own unique method. Compared to traditional Minecraft gameplay where players have to craft powerful armors and weapons and later rely entirely on them for damage and protection, Project MMO introduces a more “RPG-styled” method of progressing through the game."
				""
				"Starting the game you will not be able to use armor, decent tools and specific artifacts/relics/baubles, because this requires a certain level of the player associated with a specific item. In addition to the restrictions - leveling gives a variety of bonuses - passive(like improving your damage) or active(like the ability to salvage item for another one), thereby engaging in certain activities, you will improve your character."
				""
				"As players perform a certain action, they would get better at doing so. For example, if a player wants to become the best warrior, they can train themselves by swinging their swords all day to earn more points in strength."
