	# Mode 1: Coordinates will be converted to the other 
	# dimension's coordinate scale and the game will look for
	# a Bee Nest/Beehive at the new spot to spawn players at. 
	# If none is found, players will still be placed at the spot.
	# 
	# Mode 2: Will always spawn players at the original spot in the
	# non-BZ dimension where they threw the Enderpearl at a Bee Nest/Beehive.
	# Coordinate scale of dimension is ignored both ways.
	# 
	#Mode 3: Will use mode 1's teleportation method if Bee Nest/Beehive
	#is near the spot when exiting the dimension. If none is found,
	#then mode 2's teleportation method is used instead.
